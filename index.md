I am a postdoctoral researcher, interested in mathematical modeling and differential equations. <br>
In February 2025, I joined the group of Ansgar JÃ¼ngel at TU Wien for a postdoctoral time.
Before, I hold a COLIBRI research professorship at the University of Graz. 
I am affiliated with TU Braunschweig, where I am having a postdoctoral position, currently on leave. 



## Current Interests and Projects:

- Qualitative solution behavior of reaction diffusion equations
- Modeling real world phenomena like inflammations, wild fire, porous media, population dynamics and dynamic systems in engineering
- Using data-driven approaches for model selection in applications with few data and multiple scales
