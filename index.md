I joined Roskilde University in August 2025 as Associate Professor for Applied Mathematics, where I focus on mathematical modeling, enjoying the interplay between application, analysis and simulations. Most of my projects have in common that things interact and spread, motivating reaction diffusion equations, possibly with special features like non-locality or heterogeneity. 


Before coming to Roskilde, I was a postdoctoral researcher at TU Wien (Feb 2025 - June 2025), and at TU Braunschweig (Jan 2020 - Aug 2025). During that time, I hold a COLIBRI research professorship at the University of Graz (Oct 2024 - Jan 2025), and worked as Lecturer (Vertretungsprofessur) at HAWK Göttingen (Oct 2022 - Sep 2023). 




## Current Interests and Projects:

- Qualitative solution behavior of reaction diffusion equations
- Modeling real world phenomena like inflammations, wild fire, porous media, population dynamics, and dynamic systems in natural sciences and engineering
- Using data-driven approaches for model selection in applications with few data and multiple scales
