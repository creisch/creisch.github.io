excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a third year PhD student at [quantbiolab]([quantbiolab.com](https://quantbiolab.com/) supervised by [Prof. Ilia Solov'yov](https://quantbiolab.com/group/ilia-solovyov) at the [Carl-von-Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg](https://uol.de/en). The group develops and maintains the online platform 'Scandinavian Online Kit for Nanoscale Modeling' [VIKING](https://viking-suite.com/) which provides a user-friendly approach to molecular dynamics simulations among other things.
I joined quantbiolab after finishing my Masters at the [Ruhr-Universität Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en). My thesis dealt with periodic trajectories of billiard trajectories.

I am a member of the interdisciplinary Research Training School [RTG1885](https://uol.de/en/sensorybio) on the molecular basis of sensory biology. The RTG cooperates with the [SFB1372](https://www.sfb1372.de/) on magnetoreception and navigation in vertebrates.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Data Analysis with Python
- Methodology development for Protein analyses
