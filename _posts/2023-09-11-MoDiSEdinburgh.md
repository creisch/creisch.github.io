<b>Abstract</b><br>
Real-world phenomena are oftentimes influenced by mechanisms that act locally but change the solution behavior globally. I will present three reaction-diffusion models with this system behavior.
The spatially heterogeneous mechanisms in a reaction-diffusion model for liver inflammation change the systemâ€™s behavior from decaying to the trivial solution towards a stationary heterogeneous steady state. The change can be interpreted as the change between healing and chronic infection courses. A model for invasive mosquitoes has traveling wave solutions that may stop propagating due to local interventions. Third, firebreaks stop wildfires, and the model includes a heterogeneous bulk density as a crucial component. 
I present analytical results and open questions for predicting the changing behavior.
