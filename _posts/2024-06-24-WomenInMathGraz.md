<b>Abstract</b><br>
I was invited to give a talk for a broad audience of mathematicians and student for celebrating women in mathematics. Taking into account the different mathematical backgrounds, I presented a model on liver inflammation using reaction diffusion equations. This talk promoted applied mathematics and came along with one talk on mathematic didactics and on pure mathematics, respectively.
