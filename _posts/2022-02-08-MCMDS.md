<b>Abstract: </b>Hepatitis B and C are viruses causing liver infections and resulting ingrave secondary diseases. While there are different treatments forchronic liver infections, the process of evolving chronic diseases isstill not fully understood. This paper presents an economic-inspiredmodel for the overall health of an infected organism. The healthmodel is based on the results of a reaction diffusion model fordescribing the space-dependent dynamics of virus and T cells duringa liver infection. The different treatments affect the parametersof the reaction diffusion model and influence therefore the wellbeingof the infected person during an infection. The health modelis selected in a detailed process out of a class of possible models.The presented work provides a foundation for an optimal controlproblem for finding the best treatment strategy.<br>
