<b>Abstract</b><br>
The dynamical behavior of wildfire can be described by coupled (partial) differential equations. 
The literature deals in two main approaches with the model: On the one hand, there are rigorous mathematical proofs for sub-models including less of the mechanisms. 
On the other hand, numerical simulations show exemplary behavior of the full model in complex settings. 

A special property of the model is an unsteady reaction function for the combustion process, starting at a certain temperature. 
We present recent results in the gap between the two approaches. 
Further, the model shows transport or diffusion dominated behavior depending on the wind speed. 
We prove analytical results estimating the remaining biomass and develop conditions for stopping the spread of the fire. Numerical simulations support and extend those findings. 

Prospectives include the coupling of the wildfire dynamics to atmospheric models.
