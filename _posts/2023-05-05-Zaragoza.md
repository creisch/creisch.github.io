<b>Abstract</b><br>
Hierarchical model families for complex dynamical systems allow understanding the influence of single mechanisms on the total dynamics. 
I will present the approach of studying model families for some examples using reaction-diffusion equations and dynamical systems. 
The examples include first results on modeling and simulating wildfires, a joint project with Adrián Navas Montilla and Ilhan Özgen-Xian.
