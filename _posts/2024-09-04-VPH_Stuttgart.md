<b>Abstract</b><br>
Complex systems in life sciences often suffer from complicated or expensive data, leading to a lack of time- and space-dependent data. Macro-scale models like reaction diffusion equations allow predictions of long-term behavior which can be associated with observations on a larger length scale. An example of those processes with rare data is liver inflammations. The dynamics leading to chronic inflammation are complex, and only the outcome of chronic inflammation is observable. As the scales of mechanistic processes and observations vary widely, the reaction diffusion system is abstract, and a good representation of the mechanisms is not given a priori. One open challenge therefore is the connection of 1) the longtime behavior, 2) the abstract mechanisms in the reaction diffusion system, and 3) the known interactions on the cell-scale. We approach the challenges from two sides. First, a model family of reaction diffusion equations is presented. Based on analytical properties like the longtime behavior of solutions, one model from the family is selected. Secondly, machine learning techniques are used for selecting models based on qualitative data like long-time observations. We present an algorithm for selecting mechanisms in an ordinary differential equation setting and show challenges that arise. The combination of both approaches leads to a coupling of the different scales and takes advantage of all available information, even in cases with little data.
