<b>Abstract</b><br>
Biological processes are the result of many interacting particles on microscopic scales. While some of the particles and interactions are well known, oftentimes not all dynamics are fully understood. Therefore, pure physics-based modeling approaches are not always successful. 
Apart from that, some outcomes of the considered biological processes are usually observable on a macroscopic scale. Although, the observations mostly do not include time and space resolved measurements of all interacting components but some information at discrete times. These observations serve as quantitative data for the biological applications. The quantitative data is usually not sufficient for pure data-driven approaches. 

In this talk, ideas on how to use the rare data in a model selection process are presented: Mesoscopic models connect the different scales by abstracting from the microscopic particles and interactions. The few microscopic information on mechanisms and the observation on the macroscopic scale enable together physics-informed machine learning techniques for the mesoscopic model.
