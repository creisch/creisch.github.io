<b>Abstract</b><br>
Modeling biological processes is a highly demanding task because not all processes are yet fully understood. 
Therefore the mathematical models  include terms that abstract from the real micro-scale mechanisms. 
For these terms, experimental parameter calibration is extremely challenging as the parameter value can not be determined by single experiments. 
In this talk, we present ideas on how to overcome these difficulties by using longtime characteristics of solutions for, first, finding abstract mechanisms covering large-scale observations and, second, determining parameter values for the abstract mechanisms. 
These parameter values are not directly connected to experimental data but serve as link between known mechanisms and observations.
The framework combines machine learning techniques with characteristic solution behavior of reaction-diffusion equations. 
For testing the framework, ordinary differential equations with different complexity are used. 
This simplified setting gives insight into challenges by using rare data only.
