<b>Abstract</b><br>
Hierarchical model families provide a powerful framework for understanding how individual mechanisms shape the overall dynamics of complex systems. In this talk, I will demonstrate the utility of this approach by exploring model families derived from reaction-diffusion equations and dynamical systems. Through illustrative examples from life sciences, ecology, and computational physics, we will examine how smaller models can isolate and analyze the contributions of specific processes, offering deeper insights into complex system behavior.
