<b>Abstract</b><br>
Persistent inflammation occurs in many diseases, and often times it is not fully
understood how these inflammations evolve in time. Mathematical models provide a
theoretical framework for finding relevant parameters and testing theoretical
treatments.
I present a reaction-diffusion model for the interaction of virus and T cells during
hepatitis. The abstraction of the tissue structure motivates heterogeneous non-local
reaction terms with a high impact on the stability of steady state solutions. In the
application, this term may change the infection course from chronic to healing.
