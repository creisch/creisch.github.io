<b>Abstract</b><br>
I presented the approaches and preliminary results of the funded interdisciplinary project on adaptive mesh criteria using the monotonicity as a crucial criterion for physically meaningful numerical solutions. As a first step, we are investigating the heat equation for relaxing a strong monotonicity criterion from literature.
