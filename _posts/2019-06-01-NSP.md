<b>Abstract: </b>On the one hand, modeling and simulation get more and more important in the natural and engineering sciences, but as well in life sciences like medicine, biology, socio-dynamics and ecology within the last decades. On the other hand, a framework for model validation, model selection and the discussion of competing models is still lacking. The article proposes a formalism which enables us to separate these fields of investigation from the epistemological questions in philosophy and to consider models as parts of hierarchical model families. <br>
