<b>Abstract</b><br>
Modeling the spread of mosquitos is relevant for controlling transmitted diseases.
The population dynamics of mosquitos in winged and aquatic phase are studied using coupled reaction diffusion equations with nonlinear reaction functions. 
The spread of mosquitos can be described as a traveling wave solution of the reaction diffusion equation. 

In this presentation, the influence of control strategies on the spread of mosquitos is studied. 
Mathematically, stopping the spread of the mosquitos is connected to a change of the qualitative long-time behavior of the equation. 
We compare the influence of different strategies on the solution behavior. 
Local homogeneous strategies are modeled as a strong Allee effect on the mosquitos in the aquatic phase. 
On the other hand, spraying pesticides effects the aquatic mosquitos only in certain regions. 
As a consequence, the system has spatially heterogeneous solutions. 
We study the hierarchical model family containing the different mechanisms analytically and numerically.
