<b>Abstract</b><br>
Liver infections like hepatitis C often become chronic, but the underlying biologicalmechanisms are still unknown. Mathematical models are used to find and test hypothesesfor explaining this chronification. I present a system of reaction-diffusionequations at a tissue scale to model the interactions between the virus and T cellswithin a part of the liver during an infection. The model abstracts from individual cellsand the liver cell structure at a microscopic scale, but still reflects parts of the liverstructure, such as portal fields. The reaction functions describe predator-prey-basedinteractions between T cells and the virus. A notable feature of the model is a nonlocalterm describing the increase of T cells in the portal fields.The solutions of the reaction-diffusion system are identified with large-scale phenomenalike healing or persisting liver infections. Thus, the mathematical model connectsthe unknown mechanisms at the cell scale with the large-scale outcomes of the disease.I present and analyse models with varying complexity and different reactionterms. By examining a family of models, we gain insight into the mechanisms leadingto a higher tendency for chronification.
