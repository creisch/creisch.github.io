<b>Abstract</b><br>
Modeling inflammatory processes motivates reaction-diffusion models with nonlocal and heterogeneous reaction terms. The parameters of the nonlocal terms influence the stability of stationary states from stable behavior to instability. Starting from stable reaction diffusion equations without nonlocality, I present results on instabilities induced by a heterogeneous nonlocal term in the reaction functions.

The introduction of nonlocality in the reaction function poses new challenges: Linearizing the nonlocal system leads to a strongly coupled infinite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations for the eigenmodes. We show that the infinite dimensional linear system can be approximated by a truncated system. 
A combination of analytical and numerical results for the nonlinear, the linearized, and the truncated system shows the existence of instability depending on the nonlocality parameter. 

This is a joint work with Bao Quoc Tang (University of Graz, Austria) and Cinzia Soresina (University of Trento, Italy).
