<b>Abstract</b><br>
Liver infections like hepatitis C tend to chronify but the underlying biological mechanisms are still unknown. 
Mathematical models are used for finding and testing hypothesis for explaining chronification. 

We present a system of reaction diffusion equations on a mesoscopic scale for the virus and the T cells inside a part of the liver for modeling the interactions during a liver infection. 
The model abstracts from individual cells and the liver cell structure on a microscopic scale but still reflects parts of the liver structure like portal fields.

The reaction functions describe predator-prey based interactions of T cells and virus. 
One feature of the model is a non-local term describing the increase of T cells in the portal fields.

The solutions of the reaction diffusion system are identified with large scale phenomena like healing or persisting liver infections. 
Therefore, the mathematical model connects the unknown mechanisms on the microscopic cell scale with the large scale outcome of the disease. 

We present and analyze models with different complexity and different reaction terms. 
By regarding a family of models, we gain insight in mechanisms leading to a higher chronification tendency. 
Finally, we sort the family in a hierarchical order.
