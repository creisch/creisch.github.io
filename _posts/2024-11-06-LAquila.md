<b>Abstract</b><br>
Wildfire propagation is a highly complex process, which can be effectively modeled using a system of coupled advection-diffusion-reaction differential equations derived from fundamental physical principles. In this talk, I will first outline the derivation of the model, highlighting the physical assumptions and mechanisms embedded within the equations.

A thorough investigation, combining both analytical results and high-fidelity numerical simulations, demonstrates the critical roles played by individual physical processes. The analysis of reduced sub-models further enables estimates of the fire's rate of spread, as well as the sensitivity of this rate to key environmental and physical parameters.

Building upon the foundational model, I will present new results concerning the approximation of the nonlinear combustion reaction function. Furthermore, I will introduce an extended model that incorporates topographic variations, providing a more realistic representation of wildfire behavior in complex terrain. This extension allows for an improved understanding of how terrain features influence the rate of fire spread.
