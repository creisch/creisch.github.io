<b>Abstract</b><br>
Untreated liver infections caused by hepatitis B often persist for long times. 
The underlying mechanisms on a cell scale leading to those chronic inflammations are still partly unknown and therefore, models on a mesoscopic scale are used for testing hypothesis and gaining insight. 
I present a reaction diffusion model for the virus and T cells representing the immune system. 
The reaction terms include predator prey terms as well as nonlocal and space dependent terms. 
Depending on the parameters, the model has solutions with a tendency either to the trivial steady state or towards a nontrivial, spatially inhomogeneous steady state. 
The latter is interpreted as a chronic infection course. 
In this talk, I discuss the influence of chemotactic effects on the development of chronic infections. 
Therefore, a third component, namely a signal, is introduced and cross diffusion terms are added. 
By analyzing submodels, the effects of small and strong chemotactic parameters are studied.
