<b>Abstract</b><br>
I present a model family with linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion models, stationary models and reduced space-independent models describing the interactions of the virus and the cells of the immune system during a liver infection.

Depending on the extension of the domain and parameters like the reaction change rate and the diffusion strength, we find solutions tending to zero (healing infection courses) or solutions tending towards a stationary spatially inhomogeneous state (chronic infection courses). 
 Entropy methods are used for showing the importance of the Allee effect and the influence of strong immune reactions. 


 Different models of the model family provide insight to different aspects of the system, for example the relevance of chemotactic effects or the tendency towards inhomogeneous states.
