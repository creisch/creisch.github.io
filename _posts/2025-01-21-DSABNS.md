<b>Abstract</b><br>
In recent years, the risk and severity of wildfires have escalated due to climatechange and shifting land-use patterns. These fires not only threaten human settlementsbut also contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding the mechanismsthat drive wildfire dynamics is essential for developing effective prevention andintervention strategies.In this talk, I present a physics-based advection-diffusion-reaction model for wildfirespread. The model incorporates biomass moisture as an additional factor, extendingthe traditional wildfire models by accounting for evaporation. Modeling moisture allowsto include mechanisms outside of the wildfire model such as water uptake by plantroots and the varying drought resilience of different tree species. Vegetational patternsinfluence the initial values and parameters of the wildfire model. We show the impactof heterogeneous vegetation patterns on the spread of fire. The results have importantimplications for managing fire-prone landscapes, especially in regions experiencingincreasing environmental stress.
