<b>Abstract: </b>Here, a theoretical framework is proposed which enables us to formalize the process of mathematical modelling and to discuss the recurrent question whether a chosen model is appropriate, accurate or comprehensive with respect to a certain application. Thereto, episte-mological problems in philosophy are separated from modelling questions in the natural sciences. The background of the investigations lies in life-science applications, their inherent qualitative and quantitative uncertainties and their oftentimes unclear hierarchy of the mechanisms under consideration. The resulting description of mathematical modelling as a general approximation problem is still sufficiently rich to study model families, inheritance of model properties, model identification, minimal models and the optimality of models under different objective functions.<br>
