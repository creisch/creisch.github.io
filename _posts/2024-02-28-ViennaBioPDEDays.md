<b>Abstract</b><br>
Biological and medical applications motivate reaction-diffusion models with nonlocal and heterogeneous reaction terms. The parameters of the nonlocal terms influence the stability of stationary states from stable behavior to instability.

I present results on such instabilities induced by heterogeneous nonlocal terms in reaction-diffusion equations. The system under investigation provides new challenges compared to previously studied systems: The nonlocal term leads to a strongly coupled infinite dimensional system of ordinary differential equations for the eigenmodes. A combination of analytical and numerical results for the nonlinear, a linearized, and a truncated system shows the existence of instability depending on the nonlocality parameter.
