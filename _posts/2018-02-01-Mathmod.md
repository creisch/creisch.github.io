<b>Abstract: </b>Various mathematical models reproducing similar observations have different advantages and disadvantages. Consequently, the question evolves how to compare and relate models in a hierarchical order. We present two approaches for modeling viral liver infections such as hepatitis C, a world wide disease which chronifies in up to 75% of the cases, cf. Schwab (2011). The first model using reaction-diffusion equations allows analytical longterm behavior predictions. The second model, a cellular automaton, describes the interactions of virus and T cells in a smaller dimension and includes new mechanisms. We sort the models and their numerical realizations in a model hierarchy.<br>
