<b>Abstract</b><br>
We present the work performed during SWI2023 at the University of Groningen in relation withProblem 1 posed by the company ASMPT.ASMPT makes a very large number of different machinesfor manufacturing of electronic devices. Theyhave detailed simulation software of one of these machinesand they compare the results of this with physicalexperimental results. There is a significant differencebetween the simulated and measured data, and it is thegoal of this work to study how to estimate the parametersin the simulation model using the experimentallymeasured frequency response.First, two toy models are studied to understand thechallenges of parameter estimation in frequency domain.Later, optimization methods are applied. Several differentapproaches of reducing the dimensionality of theparameter space are explored, including determining theparameter sensitivity. A suggestion for increasing thedetail of the model, specifically related to the machinebase, is also outlined.In summary we supply a discussion of the key insightswe gained during the week.
