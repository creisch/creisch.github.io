<b>Abstract</b><br>
I present the collaboration results with Ilhan Ozgen-Xian and Adrian Navas Montilla, where we analyzed analytically and numerically an advection diffusion reaction model for wildfires. A special focus was on studying the sub-models of the complex partial differential equation system (coupled to an ordinary differential equation).
