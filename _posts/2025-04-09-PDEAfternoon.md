<b>Abstract</b><br>
Modeling inflammatory processes motivates reaction-diffusion models with nonlocal and heterogeneous reaction terms. The parameters of the nonlocal terms influence the stability of stationary states from stable behavior to instability. Starting from stable reaction diffusion equations without nonlocality, I present results on instabilities induced by a heterogeneous nonlocal term in the reaction function. 
The introduction of nonlocality in the reaction function poses new challenges: Linearizing the nonlocal system leads to a strongly coupled infinite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations for the eigenmodes. We show that the infinite dimensional linear system can be approximated by a truncated system for that the occurrence of instability can be proven. 
A combination of analytical and numerical results finally shows the instability depending on the nonlocality parameter. 
For liver inflammation, the instability of the stationary state due to the nonlocality can be interpreted as a change from chronic inflammation to a healthy state, highlighting the importance of the mathematical approaches for mathematical models.
