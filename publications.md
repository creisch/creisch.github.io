  <summary><b>The Transition of Photoreceptor Guanylate Cyclase Type 1 to the Active State</b><br>Manisha Kumari Shahu, Fabian Schuhmann, Alexander Scholten, Ilia A. Solov'yov, Karl-Wilhelm Koch<br>International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 23, 1422-0067, (2022)
  </summary>
  
Membrane-bound guanylate cyclases (GCs), which synthesize the second messenger guanosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate, differ in their activation modes to reach the active state. Hormone peptides bind to the extracellular domain in hormone-receptor-type GCs and trigger a conformational change in the intracellular, cytoplasmic part of the enzyme. Sensory GCs that are present in rod and cone photoreceptor cells have intracellular binding sites for regulatory Ca2+-sensor proteins, named guanylate-cyclase-activating proteins. A rotation model of activation involving an α-helix rotation was described as a common activation motif among hormone-receptor GCs. We tested whether the photoreceptor GC-E underwent an α-helix rotation when reaching the active state. We experimentally simulated such a transitory switch by integrating alanine residues close to the transmembrane region, and compared the effects of alanine integration with the point mutation V902L in GC-E. The V902L mutation is found in patients suffering from retinal cone-rod dystrophies, and leads to a constitutively active state of GC-E. We analyzed the enzymatic catalytic parameters of wild-type and mutant GC-E. Our data showed no involvement of an α-helix rotation when reaching the active state, indicating a difference in hormone receptor GCs. To characterize the protein conformations that represent the transition to the active state, we investigated the protein dynamics by using a computational approach based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We detected a swinging movement of the dimerization domain in the V902L mutant as the critical conformational switch in the cyclase going from the low to high activity state.<br>

  <summary><b>Exploring Post-activation Conformational Changes in Pigeon Cryptochrome 4</b><br>Fabian Schuhmann, Daniel R. Kattnig, Ilia A. Solov'yov<br>Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 125, 9652-9659, (2021)
  </summary>
  
A widespread hypothesis ascribes the ability of migratory birds to navigateover large distances to an inclination compass realized by the protein cryptochrome in the birds' retinae. Cryptochromes are activated by blue light, which induces a radical pair state the spin dynamics of which may become sensitive to earth's weak magnetic fields. The magnetic information is encoded and passed on to downstream processes by structural rearrangements of the protein, the details of which remain vague. We utilize extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to probe the conformational changes of pigeon cryptochrome 4 upon light activation. The structural dynamics are analyzed based on principal component analysis and with the help of distance matrices, which reveal significant changes in selected inter-residue distances. The results are evaluated and discussed with reference to the protein structure and its putative function as a magnetoreceptor. It is suggested that the phosphate-binding loop could act as a gate controlling the access to the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor depending on the redox state of the protein.<br>

  <summary><b>Introducing Pep McConst — A user-friendly peptide modeler for biophysical applications</b><br>Fabian Schuhmann, Vasili Korol, Ilia A. Solov'yov<br>Journal of Computational Chemistry, 42, 572-580, (2021)
  </summary>
  
We are introducing Pep McConst — a software that employs a Monte-Carlo algorithm to construct 3D structures of polypeptidechains which could subsequently be studied as stand-alone macromolecules or complement the structure of known proteins. Using an approach to avoid steric clashes, Pep McConst allows to create multiple structures for a predefined primary sequence of amino acids. These structures could then effectively be used for further structural analysis and investigations. The article introduces the algorithm and describes its user-friendly approach that was made possible through the VIKING online platform. Finally, the manuscript provides several highlight examples where Pep McConst was used to predict the structure of the C-terminal of a known protein, generate a missing bit of already crystallized protein structures and simply generate short polypeptide chains.<br>

  <summary><b>Navigation of migratory songbirds: a quantum magnetic compass sensor</b><br>Siu Ying Wong, Anders Frederiksen, Maja Hanić, Fabian Schuhmann, Gesa Grüning, P. J. Hore, Ilia A. Solov'yov<br>Neuroforum, 27, 141-150, (2021)
  </summary>
  
The remarkable ability of migratory birds to navigate accurately using the geomagnetic field for journeys of thousandsof kilometres is currently thought to arise from radical pair reactions inside a protein called cryptochrome. In this articlewe explain the quantum mechanical basis of the radical pair mechanism and why it is currently the dominant theory of compassmagnetoreception. We also provide a brief account of two important computational simulation techniques that are used to study themechanism in cryptochrome: spin dynamics and molecular dynamics. At the end, we provide an overview of current research on quantummechanical processes in avian cryptochromes and the computational models for describing them.<br>
